# Personal Kodi Skin Project - 🛑 NOT FOR PUBLIC USE 🛑

This skin is strictly not available for public use, unlike my other skins (Nimbus and FENtastic). This repository exists solely to give me the freedom to experiment and develop without constraints and to test concepts without affecting my public projects. It is my personal playground for Kodi skin development.

## Important Notes

- This skin will undergo frequent and often drastic changes without notice.
- Features will be added and removed at will, based solely on my needs and preferences.
- Bugs will appear regularly and may not be addressed immediately, if at all.
- This skin is explicitly **NOT** recommended or supported for use as a daily driver.

## No Public Contributions - 🚨 STRICTLY ENFORCED 🚨

- Feature requests, bug reports, comments, and concerns will **NOT** be accepted under any circumstances.
- The Issues tab will remain closed.
- Pull requests will be automatically closed without review.
- Forking this repository is discouraged as **NO** support will be provided.
- Any mention of this skin in my other repository issues will result in immediate closure without response.

If you're seeking stable, public Kodi skins, please refer to my other projects: [Nimbus](https://github.com/ivarbrandt/skin.nimbus) and [FENtastic](https://github.com/ivarbrandt/skin.fentastic). This repository is **NOT** the appropriate resource for users looking for a functional Kodi skin.
